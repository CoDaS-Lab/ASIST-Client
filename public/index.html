            <ul>
              <li>
                The game has three rooms and one victim located in one of the room.
                Each movement of the player in any direction is counted as one round.
                The goal of the game is to save victim in 40 rounds and under 2 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                The room view is blocked to hide the presence of the victim in it.
                The view can be unblocked to see the victim as soon as player reaches the door located at the entrance of the room indicated by light blue square box.
                Victims are represented by purple colored square box that turns yellow when saved.
              </li>
              <li>
                Victims can be saved from any of the adjacent location by pressing r key.
                Player can use the up, down, left, and right key for movement in the game.
              </li>              
              <li>
                There is a bot(leader) in the game who knows which room contains the victim and may lead the player to the correct room.
              </li>            
              <li>
                The view of the game would be similar to the picture that can be seen on this screen.
